# Web IDE for GPT Engineer

GPT Engineer now includes a web-based IDE that makes it easier for users to interact with the AI code generation features through a graphical interface rather than the command line.

## Overview

The Web IDE provides a complete environment for:

- Creating and managing projects
- Specifying requirements in natural language
- Generating code with AI assistance
- Viewing and editing generated files
- Improving existing code
- Running and testing your applications

This interface is particularly helpful for users who prefer a visual experience or are less comfortable with command-line tools.

## Installation

To use the Web IDE, you'll need to install Gradio, which is used for the web interface:

```bash
pip install gradio
```

If you installed GPT Engineer via pip, Gradio is not included by default to keep the core package lightweight. You'll need to install it separately.

## Starting the Web IDE

After installation, you can start the Web IDE with:

```bash
gpte-web
```

This will launch the web interface in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it at http://localhost:7860.

## Interface Components

The Web IDE interface is divided into several key areas:

### AI Setup

- Configure your OpenAI API key
- Select the AI model to use (GPT-4o recommended)
- Adjust temperature and other generation parameters

### Project Management

- Create new projects
- Select existing projects from the list
- Initialize the AI agent for the selected project

### Code Generation

- Specify what you want to build in natural language
- Generate code based on your specifications
- View the generated files

### Code Improvement

- Provide instructions for improving existing code
- Have the AI update your code while preserving your intent
- See a list of files modified during improvement

### File Explorer

- Browse all files in your project
- Edit file contents in the integrated code editor
- Save changes directly from the interface

### Terminal

- Run your code
- View output from executed programs
- Debug issues in your application

### AI Chat

- Ask questions about your code
- Discuss implementation details
- Get help with errors or debugging

## Workflow

A typical workflow in the Web IDE might look like:

1. Set up your AI configuration
2. Create a new project
3. Write a detailed specification
4. Generate code
5. Review the generated files
6. Make any necessary edits
7. Run and test the code
8. Use the improve feature to enhance the implementation

## Best Practices

- **Detailed Specifications**: As with the CLI version, the quality of the generated code depends on the clarity and completeness of your specifications.
- **Iterative Development**: Use the improve feature to refine your code in multiple steps rather than trying to get everything perfect in one generation.
- **Manual Editing**: While the AI can generate impressive code, manual adjustments are often necessary for fine-tuning or adding specialized functionality.
- **Save Regularly**: The Web IDE automatically saves generated code, but make sure to save manual changes frequently.

## Limitations

- The Web IDE requires an internet connection to communicate with the OpenAI API.
- Resource-intensive applications may be better tested outside the IDE.
- The integrated terminal has limitations compared to a full terminal environment.

## Advanced Features

- You can use the file explorer to create new files beyond those generated by the AI.
- The chat interface can be used to discuss design decisions with the AI.
- You can import existing projects and use the Web IDE to improve them.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Web IDE:

- Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient quota
- Check your internet connection
- Verify that Python and all dependencies are up to date
- Check the logs in the terminal where you launched the Web IDE
